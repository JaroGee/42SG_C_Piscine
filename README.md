## About

- **Username:** Mgee
- **School:** 42 Singapore @ SUTD  
- **Run:** 8  
- **Duration:** 06 October 2025 – 31 October 2025  


The Piscine is a 26-day immersion in C programming, shell, and problem-solving.

It’s tough, intense, and oddly addictive once you get into the flow.

## Exam Tips  


#### 1. Exam Registration

   - **Register** for the exam  
      **&&**
   - **Subscribe** to the event  
   - Otherwise you won't be able to take the exam  
   

#### 2. Entering the terminal    


   - Log into the terminal by entering  
     ```yami
     Username: exam
     Password: exam
     ```
     
   - To access exam shell in terminal  
     ```bash
     examshell
     ```
     
   - The exam shell only accepts these commands:
     ```yami
     status
     grademe
     finished
     ```
     

#### 3. Personal login  


   - You’ll be prompted for your own username and password.  

   - When typing your password, nothing will appear — no cursor movement or *.  

   - Just type it and press Enter.  


#### 4. Login window  


   - You have **10 minutes** to log in.  

   - If you miss it, you’ll need to log out and leave the exam.  


#### 5. Allowed items  


   - Only prescribed medication, a water bottle, and a pen are allowed.  

   - You’ll be given a blank sheet of paper and ear plugs.  

   - No electronic devices of any kind.  


#### 6. Extracting the questions  


   - When you access the exam shell, you’ll see brief on-screen instructions
     and a folder for the current question you’re attempting.
   
   - Each question appears one at a time — complete and submit it before moving on to the next.

   - Open another terminal or VScode to work on exam questions.


#### 7. Question order  


   - You must complete and pass each question in order before moving on to the next.

   - Getting stuck on one question means you can’t proceed to any others until that one is solved.


#### 8. Manual  


   - The terminal man pages are available and allowed.  


#### 9. Editor  


   - VSCode is allowed, but it comes without plugins.  


#### 10. Compiling  


   - Always compile with:  
      ```bash
      cc -Wall -Werror -Wextra
      ```  
      *These flags helped me catch errors early and pass several questions.*

## Notes


   - I included short test snippets as comments within each file, right below the solution.

   - All you have to do is remove the denotation for comments (/**/), compile then run the program to see results

   - They’re simple examples meant to check basic logic before submission.

   - Norminette compliance varies across exercises — this repo isn’t perfect, but it’s honest.
